Neuron
  Outputs an "activation energy" in [0, 1]
  Activation determined by previous neuron activations, 
  each multiplied by a weight and added to a singular bias.
    Passed through a function to force between [0, 1]

Network
  Takes in at least one input and has at least one output.
  Composed of neurons.
  Can have hidden layers in between.

  Measurable cost function, representing the sum of squares
  of the difference between the intended and actual output.

  Gradient Decent
    Minimizes the cost function to a local min.
    Each component of the gradient represents the average amount
    (across all training samples) that the network needs to adjust
    the activations of each neuron.
      Average cost on each neuron
    Use partial derivative chain rule to calculate the magnitude of
    effect a change to each weight and bias would have.
    Adjust accordingly.
